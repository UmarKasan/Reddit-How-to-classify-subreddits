I was gifted a Tushy from my mom and hooked it up to my toilet as soon as I got home from Christmas celebrations. Because it's a ""portable"" bidet, you attach it to any preexisting toilet seat. There's no need to throw away perfectly good parts of your toilet and they give you all you need to attach it to the waterline that fills the tank.

You *go*, rinse with the bidet, and dab everything dry with a few squares of toilet paper. It almost *always* comes back clean. Some people decide to use washable cloths to cut toilet paper out entirely, but I don't have in-unit laundry and all of that extra cloth would get a little expensive to wash in a coin machine. For fellow women out there, it also makes the time of the month a little bit easier. I never wanted to use wet wipes due to waste (obviously) and fragrance sensitivities, but I never felt like toilet paper was enough. If I was at home, I'd often jump in the shower for a quick rinse. I'm sure you get the gist of how a bidet helped me out in that regard...

Of all the changes I have made to reduce my waste, I think this is the most remarkable one so far. 10/10 would recommend the Tushy as an affordable low/ alternative! :) Tushy bidet attachment has successfully cut down my use of TP"

I first heard about it in a sponsored YouTube video from Gus Johnson before I started going low/zero waste, but I dismissed bidets as gross and moved on. Around Christmas when I was fully in on the zero waste spirit, I was scoping out sustainable toilet paper brands in Canada without much luck and my mind travelled back to the idea of a bidet. I was gifted a Tushy from my mom and hooked it up to my toilet as soon as I got home from Christmas celebrations. Because it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;portable&amp;quot; bidet, you attach it to any preexisting toilet seat. There&amp;#39;s no need to throw away perfectly good parts of your toilet and they give you all you need to attach it to the waterline that fills the tank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like it has changed my life! The Europeans really know how to do their business properly. You &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt;, rinse with the bidet, and dab everything dry with a few squares of toilet paper. It almost &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; comes back clean. Some people decide to use washable cloths to cut toilet paper out entirely, but I don&amp;#39;t have in-unit laundry and all of that extra cloth would get a little expensive to wash in a coin machine.

&lt;p&gt;Of all the changes I have made to reduce my waste, I think this is the most remarkable one so far. 10/10 would recommend the Tushy as an affordable low/zero waste alternative! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",1,"This is gonna sound like an ad, but I honestly can't recommend the Tushy enough to people who want to cut down on their toilet paper use. I first heard about it in a sponsored YouTube video from Gus Johnson before I started going low/, but I dismissed bidets as gross and moved on. Around Christmas when I was fully in on the  spirit, I was scoping out sustainable toilet paper brands in Canada without much luck and my mind travelled back to the idea of a bidet. I was gifted a Tushy from my mom and hooked it up to my toilet as soon as I got home from Christmas celebrations. Because it's a ""portable"" bidet, you attach it to any preexisting toilet seat. There's no need to throw away perfectly good parts of your toilet and they give you all you need to attach it to the waterline that fills the tank. 

I know this seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like it has changed my life! The Europeans really know how to do their business properly. You *go*, rinse with the bidet, and dab everything dry with a few squares of toilet paper. It almost *always* comes back clean. Some people decide to use washable cloths to cut toilet paper out entirely, but I don't have in-unit laundry and all of that extra cloth would get a little expensive to wash in a coin machine. For fellow women out there, it also makes the time of the month a little bit easier. I never wanted to use wet wipes due to waste (obviously) and fragrance sensitivities, but I never felt like toilet paper was enough. If I was at home, I'd often jump in the shower for a quick rinse. I'm sure you get the gist of how a bidet helped me out in that regard...

Of all the changes I have made to reduce my waste, I think this is the most remarkable one so far. 10/10 would recommend the Tushy as an affordable low/ alternative! :) Tushy bidet attachment has successfully cut down my use of TP"

Around Christmas when I was fully in on the  spirit, I was scoping out sustainable toilet paper brands in Canada without much luck and my mind travelled back to the idea of a bidet. I was gifted a Tushy from my mom and hooked it up to my toilet as soon as I got home from Christmas celebrations. Because it's a ""portable"" bidet, you attach it to any preexisting toilet seat. There's no need to throw away perfectly good parts of your toilet and they give you all you need to attach it to the waterline that fills the tank. 

I know this seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like it has changed my life! The Europeans really know how to do their business properly. You *go*, rinse with the bidet, and dab everything dry with a few squares of toilet paper. It almost *always* comes back clean. Some people decide to use washable cloths to cut toilet paper out entirely, but I don't have in-unit laundry and all of that extra cloth would get a little expensive to wash in a coin machine. For fellow women out there, it also makes the time of the month a little bit easier. I never wanted to use wet wipes due to waste (obviously) and fragrance sensitivities, but I never felt like toilet paper was enough. If I was at home, I'd often jump in the shower for a quick rinse. I'm sure you get the gist of how a bidet helped me out in that regard...

ZeroWaste,t2_ndprwtq,katelynfleecy,"This is gonna sound like an ad, but I honestly can't recommend the Tushy enough to people who want to cut down on their toilet paper use. I first heard about it in a sponsored YouTube video from Gus Johnson before I started going low/, but I dismissed bidets as gross and moved on. Around Christmas when I was fully in on the  spirit, I was scoping out sustainable toilet paper brands in Canada without much luck and my mind travelled back to the idea of a bidet. I was gifted a Tushy from my mom and hooked it up to my toilet as soon as I got home from Christmas celebrations. Because it's a ""portable"" bidet, you attach it to any preexisting toilet seat. There's no need to throw away perfectly good parts of your toilet and they give you all you need to attach it to the waterline that fills the tank. 

I know this seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like it has changed my life! The Europeans really know how to do their business properly. You *go*, rinse with the bidet, and dab everything dry with a few squares of toilet paper. It almost *always* comes back clean. Some people decide to use washable cloths to cut toilet paper out entirely, but I don't have in-unit laundry and all of that extra cloth would get a little expensive to wash in a coin machine. For fellow women out there, it also makes the time of the month a little bit easier. I never wanted to use wet wipes due to waste (obviously) and fragrance sensitivities, but I never felt like toilet paper was enough. If I was at home, I'd often jump in the shower for a quick rinse. I'm sure you get the gist of how a bidet helped me out in that regard...

Around Christmas when I was fully in on the  spirit, I was scoping out sustainable toilet paper brands in Canada without much luck and my mind travelled back to the idea of a bidet. I was gifted a Tushy from my mom and hooked it up to my toilet as soon as I got home from Christmas celebrations. Because it's a ""portable"" bidet, you attach it to any preexisting toilet seat. There's no need to throw away perfectly good parts of your toilet and they give you all you need to attach it to the waterline that fills the tank. 

I know this seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like it has changed my life! The Europeans really know how to do their business properly. You *go*, rinse with the bidet, and dab everything dry with a few squares of toilet paper. It almost *always* comes back clean. Some people decide to use washable cloths to cut toilet paper out entirely, but I don't have in-unit laundry and all of that extra cloth would get a little expensive to wash in a coin machine. For fellow women out there, it also makes the time of the month a little bit easier. I never wanted to use wet wipes due to waste (obviously) and fragrance sensitivities, but I never felt like toilet paper was enough. If I was at home, I'd often jump in the shower for a quick rinse.

Around Christmas when I was fully in on the  spirit, I was scoping out sustainable toilet paper brands in Canada without much luck and my mind travelled back to the idea of a bidet. I was gifted a Tushy from my mom and hooked it up to my toilet as soon as I got home from Christmas celebrations. Because it's a ""portable"" bidet, you attach it to any preexisting toilet seat. There's no need to throw away perfectly good parts of your toilet and they give you all you need to attach it to the waterline that fills the tank. 

I know this seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like it has changed my life! The Europeans really know how to do their business properly. You *go*, rinse with the bidet, and dab everything dry with a few squares of toilet paper. It almost *always* comes back clean. Some people decide to use washable cloths to cut toilet paper out entirely, but I don't have in-unit laundry and all of that extra cloth would get a little expensive to wash in a coin machine. For fellow women out there, it also makes the time of the month a little bit easier. I never wanted to use wet wipes due to waste (obviously) and fragrance sensitivities, but I never felt like toilet paper was enough. If I was at home, I'd often jump in the shower for a quick rinse.

ZeroWaste,t2_ndprwtq,katelynfleecy,"This is gonna sound like an ad, but I honestly can't recommend the Tushy enough to people who want to cut down on their toilet paper use. I first heard about it in a sponsored YouTube video from Gus Johnson before I started going low/, but I dismissed bidets as gross and moved on. Around Christmas when I was fully in on the  spirit, I was scoping out sustainable toilet paper brands in Canada without much luck and my mind travelled back to the idea of a bidet. I was gifted a Tushy from my mom and hooked it up to my toilet as soon as I got home from Christmas celebrations. Because it's a ""portable"" bidet, you attach it to any preexisting toilet seat. There's no need to throw away perfectly good parts of your toilet and they give you all you need to attach it to the waterline that fills the tank. 

I know this seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like it has changed my life! The Europeans really know how to do their business properly. You *go*, rinse with the bidet, and dab everything dry with a few squares of toilet paper. It almost *always* comes back clean. Some people decide to use washable cloths to cut toilet paper out entirely, but I don't have in-unit laundry and all of that extra cloth would get a little expensive to wash in a coin machine. For fellow women out there, it also makes the time of the month a little bit easier. I never wanted to use wet wipes due to waste (obviously) and fragrance sensitivities, but I never felt like toilet paper was enough. If I was at home, I'd often jump in the shower for a quick rinse. I'm sure you get the gist of how a bidet helped me out in that regard...

ZeroWaste,t2_ndprwtq,katelynfleecy,"This is gonna sound like an ad, but I honestly can't recommend the Tushy enough to people who want to cut down on their toilet paper use. I first heard about it in a sponsored YouTube video from Gus Johnson before I started going low/, but I dismissed bidets as gross and moved on. Around Christmas when I was fully in on the  spirit, I was scoping out sustainable toilet paper brands in Canada without much luck and my mind travelled back to the idea of a bidet. I was gifted a Tushy from my mom and hooked it up to my toilet as soon as I got home from Christmas celebrations. Because it's a ""portable"" bidet, you attach it to any preexisting toilet seat. There's no need to throw away perfectly good parts of your toilet and they give you all you need to attach it to the waterline that fills the tank. 

I know this seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like it has changed my life! The Europeans really know how to do their business properly. You *go*, rinse with the bidet, and dab everything dry with a few squares of toilet paper. It almost *always* comes back clean. Some people decide to use washable cloths to cut toilet paper out entirely, but I don't have in-unit laundry and all of that extra cloth would get a little expensive to wash in a coin machine. For fellow women out there, it also makes the time of the month a little bit easier. I never wanted to use wet wipes due to waste (obviously) and fragrance sensitivities, but I never felt like toilet paper was enough. If I was at home, I'd often jump in the shower for a quick rinse. I'm sure you get the gist of how a bidet helped me out in that regard...

Around Christmas when I was fully in on the  spirit, I was scoping out sustainable toilet paper brands in Canada without much luck and my mind travelled back to the idea of a bidet. I was gifted a Tushy from my mom and hooked it up to my toilet as soon as I got home from Christmas celebrations. Because it's a ""portable"" bidet, you attach it to any preexisting toilet seat. There's no need to throw away perfectly good parts of your toilet and they give you all you need to attach it to the waterline that fills the tank. 

I know this seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but I feel like it has changed my life! The Europeans really know how to do their business properly. You *go*, rinse with the bidet, and dab everything dry with a few squares of toilet paper. It almost *always* comes back clean. Some people decide to use washable cloths to cut toilet paper out entirely, but I don't have in-unit laundry and all of that extra cloth would get a little expensive to wash in a coin machine. For fellow women out there, it also makes the time of the month a little bit easier. I never wanted to use wet wipes due to waste (obviously) and fragrance sensitivities, but I never felt like toilet paper was enough. If I was at home, I'd often jump in the shower for a quick rinse.

#1.   [Remember the site wide rules](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/201073295-Rules-Reporting) because they are in effect on all sub on this website.

#2.   Remember the [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_please__don.27t)

#3. If you are here to earn your ideological stripes by trolling or instigating people into overacting, then you have come to the wrong sub and need to leave.    If you fail to do this and do this you will eventually end up banned.   



###My Fellow mods and I don't want this sub to have to tighten the rules like some other subs have done recently, so please remain civil, report uncivil comments, and contact us should you feel someone acting out of hand. 

###Thank you",Time to have the Talk again,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h3&gt;And by talk I don&amp;#39;t mean the one you hear as children from your parents.&lt;/h3&gt;
